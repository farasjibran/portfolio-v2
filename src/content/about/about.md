Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _Software Engineer_ at [IMP Studio](https://impstudio.id/) based out of Jakarta Timur.

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for writing code and making things on the web look pretty. I'm well acquainted with _frontend_, _backend_, _database_ and _cloud technologies_. Therefore, I strive to create simple, functional and impactful user experiences. I primarily code in **Next** and **Typescript**.

In my free time, I love to play guitar and also play Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.
